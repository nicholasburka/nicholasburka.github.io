   	 		<p>So Google, powerhungry as ever, is trying to patent the idea of an adaptive robotic personality. It would be fine for Google to be patenting a specific robot implementation they were developing, but they've patented the entire idea of an adaptive robot with a personality. The entire document bleeds generality.</p><p> This image (taken straight out of the patent's pages) gets to the heart of my issues.</p>

   	 		<p>The full patent can be read <a href="http://tinyurl.com/l9e4yfe" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
   	 		<p>And it's not like they're the first people to think of this. One of their more interesting, er, "ideas" is for a robot that takes its personality from some phone contact the user defined. The particularly eerie example the patent uses: "Adoption of personality, or some personification attributes, could be more direct, such as a simple user command to adopt a character by name: Be mom... The robot would interact with the cloud to pull sufficient information regarding the new persona to thereby recreate a simulacrum for the robot." Sounds like Google watched Season 2, Episode 2 of Black Mirror and decided that that was a <i>good</i> idea. And then they patented it! The nerve.</p>
