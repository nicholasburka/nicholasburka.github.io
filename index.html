              <h2>Future Murmurs: Constructivist Approaches to Learning Biology</h2>
              <p>An assigned reading for my Cognitive Science class was a detailed 
                description of the anatomy of the eye, and more 
                specifically the human retina. As I struggled to 
                abstract the idea of glutamate flow to a conceptual level, 
                I was reminded of a recently graduated alumnus' senior thesis 
                in Cognitive Science in which they attempted to program a single 
                node in a model of the brain and a paper by one of my professor's
                on teaching the programming language concept of "Garbage Collection"
                by attempting to apply the common Computer Science constructivist
                philosophy of teaching. I wonder if one day, biology could
                be taught in such a constructive way, where each student,
                rather than simply investigating organs (which is surely
                useful) was forced to construct one. </p>

              <h2>Rant: Working at Amazon or Google or especially Facebook
                is as morally bankrupt as working in finance</h2>
              <p>Facebook amasses data about people's personal lives and sells it.
                Google loves information so much that it does not mind taking all of
                yours and sharing it. Amazon, while beneficial for the consumer, is
                a cutthroat corporation which runs on two instincts: power (market share)
                and greed (profit motive). Jeff Bezos is a megalomaniac; Mark Zuckerberg
                an emboldened adolescent; and Gary Schmidt just wants to watch the world
                burn. </p>
